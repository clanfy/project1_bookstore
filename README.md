User Story 

"Raquel owns a book store and would like an app to help keep her on top of her inventory. She does not want an app that customers will see, but she would like an app that can add authors and books, and also take in stock levels and display and monitor her inventory, along with financial information. "

The MVP:

- use RESTful routes
- must be able to add authors and books
- must be able to view authors and books
- must be able to edit authors and books
- must be able to add and reduce inventory
- must be able to show inventory list with financial information (ie. total possible sales, markup and gross profit) 
- must be able to show stock levels with conditional formatting of high, medium or low levels
